Description: A joint model for large-scale, competing risks time-to-event data with singular or multiple longitudinal biomarkers, implemented with the efficient algorithms developed by Li and colleagues (2022) <doi:10.1155/2022/1362913> and <arXiv.2506.12741>.
             The time-to-event data is modelled using a (cause-specific) Cox 
             proportional hazards regression model with time-fixed covariates. 
             The longitudinal biomarkers are modelled using a linear mixed 
             effects model. The association between the longitudinal submodel 
             and the survival submodel is captured through shared random 
             effects. It allows researchers to analyze large-scale data to 
             model biomarker trajectories, estimate their effects on event 
             outcomes, and dynamically predict future events from patients’ 
             past histories. A function for simulating survival and longitudinal 
             data for multiple biomarkers is also included alongside built-in 
             datasets.

The `FastJM` package implement efficient computation of semi-parametric joint model of longitudinal and competing risks data.

# Example

The `FastJM` package comes with several simulated datasets. To fit a joint model, we use `jmcs` function. 

```{r}
require(FastJM)
require(survival)
data(ydata)
data(cdata)
fit <- jmcs(ydata = ydata, cdata = cdata, 
            long.formula = response ~ time + gender + x1 + race, 
            surv.formula = Surv(surv, failure_type) ~ x1 + gender + x2 + race, 
            random =  ~ time| ID)
fit
```

The `FastJM` package can make dynamic prediction given the longitudinal history information. Below is a toy example for competing risks data. Conditional cumulative incidence probabilities for each failure will be presented.

```{r}
ND <- ydata[ydata$ID %in% c(419, 218), ]
ID <- unique(ND$ID)
NDc <- cdata[cdata$ID  %in% ID, ]
survfit <- survfitjmcs(fit, 
                       ynewdata = ND, 
                       cnewdata = NDc, 
                       u = seq(3, 4.8, by = 0.2), 
                       method = "GH",
                       obs.time = "time")
survfit
```

To assess the prediction accuracy of the fitted joint model, we may run `PEjmcs` to calculate the Brier score. 
```{r}
## evaluate prediction accuracy of fitted joint model using cross-validated Brier Score
PE <- PEjmcs(fit, seed = 100, landmark.time = 3, horizon.time = c(3.6, 4, 4.4), 
             obs.time = "time", method = "GH", 
             quadpoint = NULL, maxiter = 1000, n.cv = 3, 
             survinitial = TRUE)
summary(PE, error = "Brier")
```

An alternative to assess the prediction accuracy is to run `MAEQjmcs` to calculate the prediction error by comparing the predicted and empirical risks stratified on different risk groups based on quantile of the predicted risks.

```{r}
## evaluate prediction accuracy of fitted joint model using cross-validated mean absolute prediction error
MAEQ <- MAEQjmcs(fit, seed = 100, landmark.time = 3, horizon.time = c(3.6, 4, 4.4), 
                 obs.time = "time", method = "GH", 
                 quadpoint = NULL, maxiter = 1000, n.cv = 3, 
                 survinitial = TRUE)
summary(MAEQ, digits = 3)
```

We may also calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to assess the discrimination measure of joint models.
```{r}
## evaluate prediction accuracy of fitted joint model using cross-validated mean AUC
AUC <- AUCjmcs(fit, seed = 100, landmark.time = 3, horizon.time = c(3.6, 4, 4.4),
               obs.time = "time", method = "GH",
               quadpoint = NULL, maxiter = 1000, n.cv = 3, metric = "AUC")
summary(AUC, digits = 3)
```

Alternatively, we can also calculate concordance index (Cindex) as another discrimination measure.
```{r}
## evaluate prediction accuracy of fitted joint model using cross-validated mean Cindex
Cindex <- AUCjmcs(fit, seed = 100, landmark.time = 3, horizon.time = c(3.6, 4, 4.4),
               obs.time = "time", method = "GH",
               maxiter = 1000, n.cv = 3, metric = "Cindex")
summary(Cindex, digits = 3)
```

To fit a joint model with multiple longitudinal outcomes and competing risks, we can use the `mvjmcs` function.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
data(mvydata)
data(mvcdata)
library(FastJM)
mvfit <- mvjmcs(ydata = mvydata, cdata = mvcdata,
              long.formula = list(Y1 ~ X11 + X12 + time,
                                  Y2 ~ X11 + X12 + time),
              random = list(~ time | ID,
                            ~ 1 | ID),
              surv.formula = Surv(survtime, cmprsk) ~ X21 + X22, 
              maxiter = 1000, opt = "optim",
              tol = 1e-3, print.para = FALSE)
mvfit
```

We can extract the components of the model as follows:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Longitudinal fixed effects
fixef(mvfit, process = "Longitudinal")
summary(mvfit, process = "Longitudinal")

# Survival fixed effects
fixef(mvfit, process = "Event")
summary(mvfit, process = "Event")

# Random effects for first few subjects
head(ranef(mvfit))
```

Currently, prediction and validation features (e.g., survfitjmcs, PEjmcs, AUCjmcs) are implemented for models of class jmcs. Extension to mvjmcs is under active development and will be available later this year.
